# EZ4: Develop & Deploy ðŸš€

A collection of high-quality components that make it EZ4 building modern applications on top of AWS with NodeJS and TypeScript.

## Why

Most engineering teams strive to build solid foundations and deliver value while building production-ready cloud applications (develop, test, deploy, scale, and maintain). EZ4's mission is to provide all the tools for making this possible with as little friction as possible.

## Getting started

Check out some examples to get started with.

- [Get started with API Gateway](./examples/hello-aws-gateway)
- [Get started with DynamoDB](./examples/hello-aws-dynamodb)
- [Get started with CloudFront](./examples/hello-aws-cloudfront)
- [Get started with Scheduler](./examples/hello-aws-scheduler)
- [Get started with Queue](./examples/hello-aws-queue)
- [API Gateway authorizer](./examples/aws-gateway-authorizer)
- [DynamoDB streams](./examples/aws-dynamodb-streams)
- [Storage manager](./examples/aws-storage-manager)

## Components

All components provides a common interface to handle the real resource properties and store their state between deployments.
