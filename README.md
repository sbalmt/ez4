# EZ4: Develop & Deploy ðŸš€

A collection of high-quality components that make it EZ4 building modern applications on top of AWS with NodeJS and TypeScript.

## Why

Most engineering teams strive to build solid foundations and deliver value while building production-ready cloud applications... EZ4's mission is to provide all the tools for making this possible (develop, test, deploy, scale, and maintain) with as little friction as possible.

## Components

All components provide a common interface (a.k.a contract) to handle cloud-based resources and store their state between deployments.

| Contract                                  | Local Provider                                   | AWS Provider                                                                         |

| [Database](./contracts/database/)         | [Database](./providers/local/local-database/)    | [DynamoDB](./providers/aws/aws-dynamodb/), [AWS Aurora](./providers/aws/aws-aurora/) |
