# EZ4: Develop & Deploy ðŸš€

A collection of high-quality components that make it EZ4 building modern applications on top of AWS with NodeJS and TypeScript.

## Why

Most engineering teams strive to build solid foundations and deliver value while building production-ready cloud applications (develop, test, deploy, scale, and maintain). EZ4's mission is to provide all the tools for making this possible with as little friction as possible.
