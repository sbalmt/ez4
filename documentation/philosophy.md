# EZ4: Philosophy

EZ4 exists to make software engineering easy for developers end‑to‑end (from source code to infrastructure) with as little friction as possible. Its foundation is built on three core pillars that guide every design decision.

## 1. Typing matters

EZ4 relies on TypeScript not just as a language, but as a source of truth. Types express intention, structure, and constraints directly in the codebase, eliminating the need for external IaC definitions. Contracts defined through types become the basis for validation, composition, and ultimately the infrastructure itself. In EZ4, your typings are your infrastructure.

## 2. One source, multiple destination

Everything begins with a strongly typed contract. Using built‑in providers, EZ4 transforms these contracts into runtime behavior and infrastructure resources, automatically and consistently. No additional configuration files, no duplicated definitions. The same source powers local development, testing, and cloud deployments, ensuring a seamless path from idea to production.

## 3. Serverless first

Infrastructure should accelerate product development, not slow it down. EZ4 embraces a serverless‑first mindset to provide scalability, security, and cost efficiency without demanding deep infrastructure expertise. Developers can focus on building features while the framework ensures the application evolves and scales safely, without fear of breaking the underlying platform.
